## 1) Types of Storage (Cloud + AWS mapping)

### A) Block Storage (Fast disks for servers)

* **What it is:** Storage is split into fixed-size blocks, attached to a server like a hard disk.
* **Best for:** OS disk, databases, low-latency apps.
* **AWS examples:** **EBS**, Instance Store. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][1])

### B) File Storage (Shared folder style)

* **What it is:** Storage accessed via folders/files (NFS/SMB) like a shared drive.
* **Best for:** Shared web content, shared home directories, media workflows.
* **AWS examples:** **EFS**, FSx. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][1])

### C) Object Storage (S3)

* **What it is:** Data stored as **objects** (file + metadata + unique key) inside buckets.
* **Best for:** Backups, logs, static websites, images/videos, data lakes, archives.
* **AWS example:** **Amazon S3**. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][1])

## 2) S3 Definition (What exactly S3 is)

**Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)** is **object storage** where:

* You create a **bucket** (top-level container)
* You upload **objects** (files) into that bucket
* Each object has a **key** (its “path/name” inside the bucket)
* S3 is designed for durability, scalability, and global access patterns.

---

## 3) Core “Rules” / Key Concepts in S3

### 3.1 Bucket basics (very important)

* Bucket name is **globally unique** (no one in the world can have the same bucket name).
* A bucket belongs to **one AWS Region** (you choose it during creation).

### 3.2 Bucket naming rules (must know)

For **general purpose buckets**:

* Length: **3 to 63 characters**
* Allowed: **lowercase letters, numbers, dots (.), hyphens (-)**
* Must start & end with a letter/number
* No IP-address style names (like `192.168.1.1`)
* No two adjacent periods (`..`) ([AWS Documentation][2])

### 3.3 “Folders” are not real folders (S3 reality)

S3 has a **flat** structure.

* “Folders” you see in console are just **prefixes** in object keys (example: `logs/2025/app.log`).

### 3.4 Access control high-level (how S3 permissions work)

S3 access is typically controlled using:

* **IAM permissions** (who can call S3 APIs)
* **Bucket policy** (resource policy at bucket level)
* **Block Public Access** (safety feature to prevent accidental public exposure)
* **ACLs** are mostly avoided today (AWS recommends disabling ACLs using **Bucket owner enforced**). ([AWS Documentation][3])

## 4) Bucket Creation Steps (Console)

### Step-by-step

1. Go to **AWS Console → S3**
2. Click **Create bucket**
3. **Bucket name**: choose globally unique name (follow naming rules)
4. **AWS Region**: select region (ex: ap-south-1)
5. **Object Ownership**

   * Keep **Bucket owner enforced (ACLs disabled)** (recommended default) ([AWS Documentation][3])
6. **Block Public Access**

   * Keep **ON** (recommended unless you intentionally host public website content)
7. **Bucket Versioning**

   * Enable if you want rollback/recover older versions (optional but best practice for important data)
8. **Default encryption**

   * Keep enabled (recommended)
9. Click **Create bucket**

---

## 5) Max File Size to Upload into S3 (Very common interview + real use)

### A) Actual S3 object size limit

* **Max object size in S3: up to 5 TB** ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][4])

### B) Upload method limits (this is the real trap)

1. **Single PUT upload limit (API/CLI/SDK): up to 5 GB**

   * If file > 5 GB, you must use **Multipart Upload** ([AWS Documentation][5])
2. **Multipart upload (recommended for large files)**

   * Supports very large objects; AWS docs mention multipart upload limits like **10,000 parts**, **part size 5 MiB to 5 GiB** ([AWS Documentation][6])
3. **S3 Console upload limit**

   * S3 Console can upload a single object up to **160 GB** (console UI limit). ([AWS Documentation][5])

 Simple way to explain:

* “S3 can store up to **5 TB** object, but upload method decides the limit:

  * PUT: **5 GB**
  * Console: **160 GB**
  * Multipart: use for big files (best practice).” ([AWS Documentation][5])

## 6) Create a “Folder” and Upload Data (Console)

### Create folder (prefix)

1. Open your bucket
2. Click **Create folder**
3. Enter folder name (example: `project-logs/`)
4. Click **Create folder**

### Upload files into that folder

1. Open the folder (prefix)
2. Click **Upload**
3. **Add files** / **Add folder**
4. Click **Upload**

### What actually happens internally

* If you upload `app.log` inside `project-logs/`, the object key becomes:

  * `project-logs/app.log`

---

## 7) Practical “S3 Rules” to mention while explaining (real-world)

### Data safety rules

* Keep **Block Public Access ON**
* Prefer **bucket policy** over ACLs
* Use **Bucket owner enforced** to avoid ACL complexity ([AWS Documentation][3])

### Operational rules

* Use **Versioning** for critical buckets (protect against overwrite/delete)
* Use **Lifecycle policies** for cost (move old data to cheaper storage classes)
* Use **Multipart upload** for large files to reduce failures + improve speed ([AWS Documentation][7])
