## Audit Trail – Small Introduction (IAM Context)

AWS CloudTrail provides an **audit trail** in AWS.
An audit trail means a **record of every action performed by a user, role, or AWS service** in your AWS account.

Whenever a user does anything like:

* Login to AWS
* Create or delete an EC2 instance
* Attach or remove an IAM policy
* Change security settings

AWS **records who did what, when, from where, and using which service**.

## Searching Audit Trail by Username (Very Important for IAM)

Using **CloudTrail**, you can search logs **based on IAM username or role name**.

You can answer questions like:

* Which IAM user deleted an EC2 instance?
* Who modified an IAM policy?
* At what time was a resource accessed?
* From which IP address did the user login?

This is extremely useful for:

* **Security investigation**
* **Compliance & audits**
* **Troubleshooting production issues**
* **Tracking misuse or unauthorized access**

## Simple Real-Time Example (Interview Friendly)

> “In our project, whenever any issue happened in production, we used CloudTrail to check the audit trail and identify **which IAM user or role performed the action**, along with timestamp and source IP.”

---

## One-Line Definition (For Interviews)

> **Audit Trail is a log of all AWS account activities that helps track user actions, security events, and changes using CloudTrail.**
