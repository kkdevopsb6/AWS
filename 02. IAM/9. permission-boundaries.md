# IAM Permissions Boundary – In-Depth Documentation

AWS Identity and Access Management supports **Permissions Boundaries** to control **how much permission an IAM identity can ever have**, even if more permissions are granted later.

A permissions boundary acts as a **maximum permission limit**, not a grant.

---

## 1. What Is a Permissions Boundary (Core Concept)

A **permissions boundary** is a **managed policy** that defines the **upper limit of permissions** for:

* IAM users
* IAM roles

It answers this question:

> “What is the maximum this user or role is allowed to do?”

Even if additional permissions are attached, **actions outside the boundary are always blocked**.

---

## 2. What a Permissions Boundary Is NOT

To avoid confusion, permissions boundary:

* ❌ Does NOT grant permissions by itself
* ❌ Does NOT apply to IAM groups
* ❌ Does NOT apply to the AWS root user
* ❌ Does NOT override explicit Deny
* ❌ Does NOT replace SCPs

It only **limits what Allow policies can do**.

---

## 3. How AWS Evaluates Permissions With Boundary (Very Important)

AWS evaluates permissions in this order:

1. **Explicit Deny** (anywhere) → DENY
2. **SCPs** (if in Organizations) → LIMIT
3. **Permissions Boundary** → LIMIT
4. **Identity-based policies** → ALLOW
5. **Implicit Deny** → DENY

Final rule:

> An action is allowed **only if it is allowed by BOTH**
> the identity policy **AND** the permissions boundary.

---

## 4. Visual Way to Understand (Concept)

Think of three layers:

* Identity Policy → “What access is given”
* Permissions Boundary → “Maximum allowed”
* SCP → “Organization-level ceiling”

If any layer blocks → access is denied.

---

## 5. Simple Example (Conceptual)

* User has `AdministratorAccess`
* Permissions boundary allows only:

  * EC2
  * S3 read-only

Result:

* User appears admin
* But can **only use EC2 and S3 read**
* IAM, RDS, Lambda → denied

---

## 6. Why Permissions Boundaries Exist

AWS introduced permissions boundaries to:

* Prevent privilege escalation
* Safely delegate IAM user creation
* Enforce least privilege
* Protect accounts from accidental admin access

Very common in:

* Large organizations
* Dev / QA / sandbox accounts
* Delegated admin models

---

## 7. Where Permissions Boundaries Are Used (Real Use Cases)

### A) Developer Self-Service Model

Developers:

* Can create IAM roles
* Can attach policies
* But cannot exceed boundary limits

Boundary ensures:

* No admin access
* No IAM modification
* No billing access

---

### B) CI/CD Role Control

CI/CD role:

* Needs EC2, ECR, ECS
* Must never touch IAM

Boundary:

* Allows only deployment-related services
* Blocks IAM completely

---

### C) Prevent Accidental Admin Access

Even if someone attaches:

* `AdministratorAccess`

Boundary ensures:

* Only approved services are accessible

---

## 8. Permissions Boundary Policy Example (Concept)

Boundary policy (maximum allowed):

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:*",
        "s3:GetObject"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

This boundary:

* Allows EC2 full
* Allows S3 read only
* Blocks everything else forever

---

## 9. Important Rules and Limits

### Boundary Type

* Must be a **managed policy**
* Inline policies ❌ not allowed

---

### Attachment

* One boundary per user or role
* Boundary can be changed or removed (if permitted)

---

### Size and Version Limits

Boundary follows **managed policy limits**:

* Size: **6,144 characters**
* Versions: **5**
* Attachments: Unlimited

## 10. Permissions Boundary vs SCP (Clear Difference)

| Feature               | Permissions Boundary | SCP          |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | ------------ |
| Scope                 | User / Role          | Account / OU |
| Applies to            | IAM identities       | AWS accounts |
| Grants permissions    | No                   | No           |
| Restricts permissions | Yes                  | Yes          |
| Root user affected    | No                   | Yes          |

---

## 11. Permissions Boundary vs Inline Policy

| Aspect            | Permissions Boundary  | Inline Policy     |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ----------------- |
| Purpose           | Limit max permissions | Grant permissions |
| Reusable          | Yes                   | No                |
| Visibility        | Central               | Hidden            |
| Privilege control | Strong                | Weak              |

---

## 12. Very Common Misunderstandings

### “Boundary allows access”

❌ Incorrect
Boundary only defines **what is allowed at maximum**

---

### “Admin policy bypasses boundary”

❌ Incorrect
Boundary always limits admin

---

### “Boundary applies to groups”

❌ Incorrect
Only users and roles

---

### “Boundary replaces SCP”

❌ Incorrect
They work together

---

## 13. Permissions Boundary + IP/MFA Conditions

Boundaries can include conditions:

* IP restrictions
* MFA enforcement
* Time-based access

This makes them very powerful when combined with identity policies.

---

## 14. When NOT to Use Permissions Boundary

* Small single-admin accounts
* Simple learning labs
* Accounts without delegated IAM control

They add complexity if not required.

---

## 15. Best Practices

* Create **standard boundary policies**
* Apply boundary during user/role creation
* Prevent boundary removal via SCP
* Use boundaries for developers and automation
* Audit boundary usage regularly

---

## 16. One Clear  Statement

> “A permissions boundary defines the maximum permissions an IAM user or role can ever have, regardless of what other policies are attached.”

---

## 17. Summary (High-Level)

* Permissions boundaries **limit**, not grant
* Admin access cannot bypass them
* They prevent privilege escalation
* Essential for secure delegation
* Work together with SCPs and IAM policies
